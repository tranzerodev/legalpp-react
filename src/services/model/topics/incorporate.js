    'NOTE_1.5': `In certain states, such as California, neither a real estate brokerage company nor a company operating as a profession may be organized as an LLC. Click <a class="lg-show-description" href="#link_1_5">here</a> for more information. <description id="link_1_5">{{LINK_1_5}}<a href="#">Close</a></description> However, in California, a business engaged in the practice of architecture, engineering, land surveying, law or public accountancy is permitted to organize itself as a limited liability partnership. (Cal. Corp. Code §16101(8)(A)) Unless an election is made otherwise, an LLC with two or more members and a limited liability partnership with two more partners are each considered to be a partnership for income tax purposes. (Treas. Reg. §301.7701-3(b)(1)(i)) Accordingly, if your business has two or more owners, is engaged in the practice of one of these professions and intends to be organized in California, then a limited liability partnership may be used in lieu of an LLC, with the same federal income tax consequences as that of an LLC. In California, a real estate brokerage company may not be organized as a limited liability partnership. Accordingly, if you have a California real estate brokerage company with one owner, you may either incorporate your business or operate it as a sole proprietorship; if your California real estate brokerage company has two or more owners, you may either incorporate the business or operate it as a general partnership. Because each partner in a general partnership is personally liable for the acts of the other partners and employees as well as the contracts of the partnership (Cal. Corp. Code §16306(a); Cal. Civil Code §2338), organization as a general partnership is generally not recommended for real estate brokerage companies.`,
    NOTE_2: `Businesses with employees or which enter into significant contracts should consider organizing as a corporation or LLC.

By contrast, the income from an LLC, limited partnership or S corporation may be eligible for such deduction. The second principal disadvantage of a C corporation is that any losses sustained by the corporation are not passed through to the shareholders until the corporation liquidates. The corporation may carry forward such losses indefinitely and during such time may deduct such losses from any profit.(IRC §172(b)(1)(A))  In the case of an S corporation, by comparison, any losses are passed through to the shareholders who may deduct such losses in the year in which they were sustained, subject to certain limitations. (IRC §1366) These disadvantages must be weighed against the potential savings on capital gains taxes that a shareholder would realize on the sale of qualified small business stock for a profit after a five year holding period.

    NOTE_7: `While an S corporation can avoid self-employment taxes on net profit (after payment of the owner’s reasonable salary), an S corporation will not reduce self-employment taxes in the absence of such net profit. At the same time, an LLC offers a simple inexpensive means of limiting the owner’s liability for the business’s contracts and the acts of its agents. Specifically, an LLC with a single owner will be treated as a disregarded entity for income tax purposes (unless it file an election for corporate treatment). (Treas. Reg. §301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii)) As a result, absent such an election, the owner will not be required to file a separate federal income tax return for the LLC. Instead, the owner will report the LLC’s earnings on his or her individual income tax return.
      In addition, an LLC (particularly a Delaware LLC) provides greater asset protection to the owner or owners than does a corporation. (Click <a class="lg-show-description" href="#link_7_1">here</a> for more information.)<description id="link_7_1">{{LINK_7_1}}<a href="#">Close</a></description>

(IRC §1361(b)(1)(D)). Second, venture capital funds often invest with the goal of guiding the business to an initial public stock offering, which is not feasible for LLCs or S corporations. Finally, venture capital funds often have pension plans as investors and investing in a business structured as an S corporation or an LLC exposes pension plans (and any other tax exempt investors) to unrelated business income tax (See IRC §511(a) and §513(a)); investing in a C corporation does not because C corporations pay dividends, and dividends are exempt from the unrelated business income tax.

If the business is structured as an S corporation, any working owner could be both a shareholder and an employee of the corporation. As such, the owner would receive two forms of income from the corporation: employment (W2) income which is subject to self-employment taxes and shareholder distributions which are not subject to self-employment taxes so long as the corporation pays the owner a reasonable amount of employment income.

    NOTE_10: `A business that does not allocate income and losses proportionally to its owners cannot be organized as an S corporation because an S corporation allows only “one class of stock”.

(IRC §704(b)) Such a business could be formed as a C corporation with more than one class of stock. However, a C corporation has two principal disadvantages to a small business. The first principal disadvantage of a C corporation as compared to an LLC is that neither the income of a C corporation (IRC §199A(a)) nor the dividends received by a C corporation shareholder (IRC §199A(c)(3)(B)(ii)) are eligible for the deduction for qualified business income while the income from an LLC (that is taxed as a partnership) may be eligible for such deduction.

The corporation may carry forward such losses indefinitely and during such time may deduct such losses from any profit.

      'Because the income of a C corporation is not eligible for the 20% deduction for qualified business income (I.R.C. § 199A(a)) and the losses of a C corporation are not immediately deductible by the shareholders, a C corporation is not an efficient structure for a real estate investment company. While the income of an S corporation may be eligible for the qualified business income deduction and its losses may be immediately deducted by the shareholders (subject to certain limitations), an S corporation is generally a disadvantageous structure for a real estate investment company as compared to an LLC that is taxed as a partnership (or as a disregarded entity). There are several reasons for this. First, the LLC (taxed as a partnership) allows special allocation of income, deductions, profits and losses (See IRC §704(b)) which are often used in real estate companies. By contrast, use of an S corporation precludes the use of special allocations due to the requirement that an S corporation have only “one class of stock”. (IRC §1361(b)(1)(D)) Second, if the investment company intends to buy and hold depreciable real estate and finance the acquisition with non-recourse financing, the S corporation form may limit the deductions that may be passed through to the shareholders. Shareholders of an S corporation and members of an LLC may not take deductions in excess of the basis of their investment in the entity. (IRC §1366(d)(1)(S corporations); IRC §704(d)(partnerships)). An LLC member’s basis includes his share of non-recourse loans (Treas. Reg. §1.752-3); an S corporation shareholder’s basis does not. (Treas. Reg. §1366-2(a)(2)) Thus it is possible that an S corporation shareholder will be precluded from taking depreciation deductions in the case of certain leveraged, depreciable real estate. Third, contributions of property to a partnership where liabilities assumed by the partnership exceed the partner’s basis are not usually taxable transactions (IRC §752(b); Treas. Reg. §1.752-1(c)) But transfers of property to a corporation for stock where liabilities assumed by the corporation exceed the shareholder’s basis in the property are taxable to the shareholder. (IRC §357(c)). Fourth, members of an LLC (taxed as a partnership) are eligible for a step-up in the basis of assets upon: the death of a partner, certain partnership distributions and the sale or exchange of a partnership interest (IRC §754); shareholders in an S corporation are not so eligible. Fifth, distributions of property from an LLC (taxed as a partnership) to its members are not taxable transactions (IRC §731) while distributions of property from an S corporation to a shareholder results in taxable gain to the S corporation to the extent the fair market value of the distributed property exceeds its basis in the hands of the distributing corporation. (IRC §311(b)) Sixth, under the 2017 tax reform legislation, an individual taxpayer is allowed a deduction of up to 20% of qualified business income, whether the business is owned directly by such individual or through a partnership or S corporation. (IRC §199A) However, if the business is organized as an S corporation, then the shareholders working in the business will be required to be paid “reasonable compensation” (Rev. Rul. 59-221, 1959-1 C.B. 225: Rev. rul. 74-44, 10974-1 C.B. 287) and any such reasonable compensation is not eligible for this 20% tax deduction. (IRC §199A(c)(4)(A)) There is no requirement that members of an LLC taxed as a partnership be paid reasonable compensation.',

      'LLCs pay an annual California LLC tax equal to the minimum franchise tax, currently $800. (Cal. Rev & Tax Code §17941). LLCs also must pay an LLC fee if annual total California source income is $250,000 or more. (Cal. Rev & Tax Code §17942). The fee is as follows: $900 if total California source income is $250,000 or more but less than $500,000; $2500 if total Cal. income is $500,000 or more but less than $1 million; $6000 for annual total Cal. income of $1 million or more but less than $5 million; or $11,790 for annual total Cal. income of $5 million or more. Total California income equals California gross income plus costs of goods sold. (See Cal. Rev & Tax Code §17942(b)(1)) “Gross income” has the meaning given in Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code. (Cal. Rev & Tax Code §24271(a)) Thus gross income includes “gains derived from dealing in property” (IRC §61(a)(3)) and “rents” (IRC §61(a)(5)).  Furthermore, total income does not include income of the LLC derived from property in other states. The LLC tax and the LLC fee must be paid by all LLCs, even single member LLCs that are disregarded entities for Federal and California income tax purposes. (Cal. Rev & Tax Code §23038(b)(2)(B)(iii))<br /> California franchise tax on a limited partnership is limited to $800. (Cal. Rev & Tax Code §17935) When a real estate investment company is structured as a limited partnership it typically allocates a small ownership interest to the general partner (such as 1%) and organizes the general partner as an LLC to provide liability protection to the general partner. As a result, a limited partnership owning California real estate generally must file two California tax returns: one for the LLC general partner and one for the limited partnership entailing at least $1600 in franchise taxes. Consequently, when an investment company expects to earn less than $1 million in California rental income and capital gains, such a company often pays lower franchise taxes and accounting fees if structured as an LLC (which files a single California return) rather than as a limited partnership. By contrast, when an investment company expects to earn more than $1 million in California rental income and capital gains, it will often save money by organizing as a limited partnership with an LLC general partner.',

      'In a sole proprietorship, an individual owns a business without any partners and without creation of any legal entity. In a general partnership, two or more individuals own a business together and share in the profits, but without a corporate or other limited liability form of entity. In both cases, the owners are personally liable on all of the company’s contracts and debts (See Cal Corp. Code §16306(a))(general partnership)); they are also legally responsible for all of the acts of the company’s employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment under a legal doctrine called respondeat superior. (See Cal. Civil Code §2338) By contrast, in general, the owners of LLCs and corporations are not liable for the debts or liabilities of the LLC or corporation. (See, e.g., Cal. Corp. Code §17703.04(a)(2) (LLCs); United States v. Best Foods, 524 U.S. 51, 61 (1998) (corporations)) Thus, while LLCs and corporations are generally liable for the acts of their agents and employees, the owners of the LLC or corporation are generally protected from liability for acts of company agents unless the owner expressly authorizes or participated in such act. (See Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Company, 24 Cal. 3d 773, 785 (1979)) As a result, if you expect to have employees, assistants or other agents working in your business, forming a corporation or LLC will help protect you from liability for their misconduct. Similarly, if you expect that your business will enter into significant contracts, a corporation or LLC would provide similar liability protection as long as you do not personally guaranty such contracts. Of course, the greater your personal assets and the greater your current and future earning capacity, the more important is such liability protection. While sole proprietors and general partnerships may and should obtain liability protection by purchasing liability insurance, all insurance policies have limits and exclusions which could result in the company’s owners suffering personal judgments for the company’s obligations if the company is not organized as a corporation or LLC.',

      <br /><br /><strong>Reducing Self-Employment Taxes with an S Corporation.</strong>
      If you structure your company as an S corporation, you could be both a shareholder and an employee of the corporation. As such, you would receive two forms of income from the corporation: employment (W2) income which is subject to self-employment taxes and shareholder distributions which are not subject to self-employment taxes so long as the corporation pays the owner a reasonable amount of employment income. ((Rev. Rul. 59-221, 1959-1 C.B. 225; Rev. Rul. 74-44, 10974-1 C.B. 287; Spicer Accounting v. United States, 918 F.2d 90 (9th Cir. 1990)) According to the IRS, “generally, reasonable pay is the amount that a similar business would pay for the same or similar services”.  (Publication 535 (2016), Business Expenses, Employee’s Pay) In short, as long as the corporation pays a shareholder-employee a reasonable salary, all other distributions by the corporation to the shareholder-employee are free of self-employment taxes. Thus if your business earns a profit after payment of all business expenses and a reasonable salary to you, you will avoid self-employment tax on such profit if your business is structured as an S corporation but would have to pay self-employment tax on such profit if your business is not incorporated.
      <br /><br /><strong>Calculating your Savings on Self Employment Taxes.</strong>
      Self-employment taxes include social security and Medicare taxes. Social security tax is equal to 12.4% of all employment income (See IRC §1401(a)) up to the contribution and benefit base for that year (IRC §1402(b)(1)), which in 2018 is $128,200. Medicare tax is equal to 2.9% of all employment income without any ceiling (See IRC §1401(b)(1)). Thus, employment income of up to $128,200 is subject to self-employment taxes of 15.3%. One half of such self-employment taxes are deductible. (IRC §164(f)). There is an additional Medicare tax of 0.9% of all employment income over a certain threshold, which is $250,000 for a married couple filing jointly, $125,000 for a married couple filing separately or $200,000 for all other filers. (IRC §1401(b)(2)). None of this additional Medicare tax is deductible.
      Your savings in self-employment taxes will be equal to the self-employment taxes you would be required to pay on your net profit (if you did not incorporate) less the after tax value of the lost deduction on one half of such self-employment taxes. If the gross business profit (after payment of all expenses but before payment of your salary) is no more than $128,200 (the maximum income subject to social security tax), and assuming you are in the 24% tax bracket, your savings from incorporation (disregarding any state income or franchise tax) would be as follows:
          <p>(15.3% X net profit) – (15.3% X ½ X 24% X net profit).</p>
      The amount in the first set of parentheses is the savings in self-employment taxes; the amount in the second set of parentheses is the after tax value of the lost deduction that results from your reduction in self-employment taxes. The above formula may be simplified as follows:
          <p>13.5% X net profit</p>
      Accordingly, if you are in the 24% federal tax bracket and the net profit of your business (after payment of your reasonable salary) is $100,000, you could expect to save $13,500 in taxes (which is 13.5% of $100,000) by incorporating.`,

      'First, any liability of a dissolved corporation may be collected from a shareholder of the corporation to the extent of any liquidating distributions received by the shareholder from the corporation, but not greater than the shareholder’s pro rata share of such liability.

(6 Del. Code §18-804(c)) In other words, the shareholders of a corporation are subject to creditor claims against any liquidating distributions received by them whether or not the corporation was insolvent when it made such distributions; the owners of a Delaware LLC are not. Second, the judgment creditor of a shareholder is entitled to attach the shares of stock owned by such shareholder and cause them to be sold at public auction. (See, e.g., 8 Del. Code §324(a)) But the judgment creditor of a member of a Delaware LLC is not entitled to foreclose on the member’s interest in the LLC; instead, the entry of a charging order (similar to a lien) is the sole remedy available to the judgment creditor.

      The amount in the first set of parentheses is your savings in self-employment taxes; the amount in the second set of parentheses is the after tax value of the lost deduction that results from your reduction in self-employment taxes. The above formula may be simplified as follows:
      <p>13.5% X your share of net profit</p>
      Accordingly, if: (a) you are in the 24% federal tax bracket (b) your share of the annual net profit of your business (after payment of reasonable owner salaries) is $50,000 and (c) your W2 salary is not more than $78,200 (which is $128,200 less $50,000), then you could expect to save $6750 per year in self-employment taxes (which is 13.5% of $50,000) by incorporating.`,
    LINK_11_1: `If your taxable income exceeds $207,500 or in the case of a joint return, $415,000, then the amount of your business income deduction is the lesser of (i) 20% of your business income, or (ii) the greater of (a) 50% of the W–2 wages paid with respect to such business or (b) the sum of 25% of the W–2 wages with respect to such business plus 2.5% of the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of all qualified property owned by such business. (IRC §199A(b)(2))`,
    LINK_11_2: `<p class='text-center'><strong>Privacy and LLCs</strong></p>
    In California and most other states, corporations and LLCs that are organized or registered in such state must file periodic statements with the state identifying, in the case of a corporation, the name and business or residence address of each of the principal officers of the corporation (see, e.g., Cal. Corp. Code §1502(a) and §2117(a)(2)), or in the case of an LLC, the name and business or residence address of each owner or if manager-managed, each manager, of the LLC. (See, e.g., Cal. Corp. Code §17702.09(a)(5)) These statements are available to the public. Thus, an individual owner of an LLC or corporation who intends to be active in the management of such entity will typically have to disclose his or her name and address in a public filing.
    One structure that enables an individual owner of an LLC to protect his or her privacy relies on the anonymity of Delaware LLCs. An LLC organized in Delaware is not required by the State of Delaware to file or publicly disclose the names of its members or managers. This structure also relies on the fact that managers and members of an LLC may themselves be LLCs. (See, e.g., Cal. Corp. Code §17701.02(n), (p) and (v)) Finally, this structure relies on a law that exists in most states that an out-of-state LLC is not required to register in that state merely because of its status as a member or manager of an in-state LLC. (See, e.g., Cal. Corp. Code §17708.03(c)(6)) As a result, suppose an individual (Adam) wants to form an LLC in California to operate a business with another individual (Eve). Adam would like to participate in the management of the LLC but wishes to keep his identity private. Adam could first form an LLC in Delaware of which he was the sole member. Eve and the Delaware LLC could then both form a California LLC of which Eve and the Delaware LLC were the members and managers. The California LLC would be required to file periodic statements (called Statements of Information) listing Eve and the Delaware LLC as managers, but such Statements of Information would not be required to disclose Adam’s name as Adam would not be a manager of the California LLC. Adam would own and manage the Delaware LLC, but as mentioned above, the State of Delaware does not require the public disclosure of the members or managers of a Delaware LLC. Finally, assuming the Delaware LLC had no connection to the State of California other than its status as a member and manager of a California LLC, it would not be required to register in California. (See Cal. Corp. Code §17708.03(c)(6)) As a result, the Delaware LLC would not be subject to the California law requiring the filing of Statements of Information by foreign LLCs registered in California.
    This structure offers one important additional benefit and one unavoidable burden. The burden arises from the fact that an out-of-state LLC that is the sole owner of a California LLC is generally required to file an LLC tax return in California and pay the $800 minimum annual franchise tax in California. (See Cal. Franchise Tax Board, Legal Ruling 2018-1) Accordingly, while Adam’s Delaware LLC need not register in California under the above facts, it will be required to file annual California tax returns and pay an annual $800 franchise tax to the State of California due to its ownership and management of a California LLC.
    <img class='w-100 img-responsive' src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/legalmaven-templates/assets/topic_incorporate_1.png' alt='' />
    The additional benefit arises from Delaware’s liability protection for owners of Delaware LLCs against Claw-Backs for Post-Liquidation Claims. A “Claw-Back” is an action against a member of the LLC to return to the LLC or a creditor some or all of the distributions received by the member from the LLC. All states provide very strong protections for LLC members against the claims of creditors of the LLC, except in the case of Claw-Backs. A “Post-Liquidation Claim” is a claim against the LLC that arises after liquidation. Under Delaware law, as a general rule, a Post Liquidation Claim against a dissolved LLC may not be Clawed-Back from a member of the LLC. (See 6 Del. Code §§13-1304(a)(2)(b), 13-1305, and §18-804(c))) By contrast, under California law, a Post-Liquidation claim against a dissolved LLC may be Clawed-Back. Specifically, California gives a creditor holding a Post-Liquidation Claim the right to collect such claim from a member of the LLC to the extent of any liquidating distributions received by the member from the LLC (Cal. Corp. Code §17707.07(a)(1)(B)) so long as suit on the claim is filed within four years of the LLC’s dissolution. (Cal. Corp. Code §17707.07(a)(2)) Thus, consider what happens if the California LLC liquidates, makes a liquidating distribution of $1 million to Eve and the Delaware LLC and six months later receives a $1 million Post-Liquidation Claim. Under California law, the creditor holding the $1 million Post-Liquidation Claim may collect such claim from Eve and the Delaware LLC up to the amount of their $1 million in liquidating distributions. However, if the Delaware LLC had already paid its share of the liquidating distributions to Adam, then the creditor may not Claw-Back such funds from Adam under Delaware law.`
