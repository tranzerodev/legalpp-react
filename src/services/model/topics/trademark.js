    NOTE_3: `<strong>Foreign term</strong> – foreign terms are any non-English words (not including fictitious words). Under the doctrine of foreign equivalents, foreign terms are translated into English to see if they are generic or descriptive when the terms come from a common, modern language and an American familiar with such foreign language is likely to translate the foreign terms into English. (TMEP §1209.03(g)). If the English equivalent of such terms is generic or descriptive, the mark may be denied registration.`,
    NOTE_5:
      '<strong>Generic</strong> – marks that are generic terms are not eligible for trademark protection. (See 15 U.S.C §1064(3); TMEP §1209.01(c)). Examples of such terms include "toy", "table", "burger", "big burger".',
    NOTE_7: `<strong>Suggestive</strong> – Marks that are suggestive are registrable without proof of secondary meaning. (TMEP §1209.01(a)). To determine if your mark is suggestive, ask: does the mark suggest qualities or characteristics of the goods or services without actually describing them? For example, Coppertone suntan lotion and Tide clothing detergent both suggest connotations of their products without actually describing the product itself.

      <strong>Arbitrary</strong> – Marks that are arbitrary are among the strongest applicants for trademark. Arbitrary marks are entirely unrelated to the product with which they are associated. Is your mark unrelated to the goods or services? For example, Camel cigarettes and Apple computers are both arbitrary terms that have no connection to the products themselves.
      
      <strong>Fanciful</strong> – Marks that are fanciful are among the strongest applicants for trademark. Fanciful words are those invented words with no dictionary or other known meaning. For example, Kodak and Exxon are both fictitious words created solely to name the associated companies.
      
      <strong>Descriptive</strong> – Marks that are merely descriptive are not eligible for the Principal Register without secondary meaning. (15 U.S.C. §§1052(e)(1) and 1052(f); TMEP §1209.01(b)). To determine if your mark is descriptive, ask:
        - What would the mark mean to an uninformed consumer? 
          <ul>
          <li>Would the consumer know what the product is based purely upon your mark?</li>
          <li>If yes, the mark is likely descriptive.</li>
          <ul>
        - Does your mark merely convey information about the goods or services?
          <ul>
            <li>If yes, the mark is likely descriptive.</li>
          </ul>

      Note that there is a distinction between descriptive and suggestive – for instance, Coppertone suntan lotion does not describe the product but creates an association of bronzed skin. If your mark is merely descriptive, you may still be eligible for the Principal Register if your mark has secondary meaning; otherwise you should apply to the <a class="lg-show-description" href="#link_10"><strong>Supplemental Register</strong></a><description id="link_10">{{NOTE_10}}<a href="#">Close</a></description>. Marks that are “inherently distinctive” (suggestive, arbitrary, fanciful) do not require secondary meaning, all other marks may require some evidence that consumers associate the mark with the origin of the goods or services, namely your company.`,
    NOTE_9: `<strong>Geographically descriptive</strong> – marks that are geographically descriptive are not eligible for trademark without secondary meaning. (15 U.S.C. §§1052(e)(2) and 1052(f); TMEP §1210). Geographically descriptive terms are those that would suggest to the consumer the geographic origin of the goods or services. To determine if your mark is geographically descriptive, ask:
      - Would consumers be led to believe the products originated in the geographic location?
        <ul>
          <li>If yes, then the mark will likely require secondary meaning.</li>
          <li>If not, then the use is likely arbitrary.</li>
      - Is the geographic location known for the particular goods or services? 
        <ul>
          <li>If yes, then the mark will require secondary meaning.</li>
          <li>If not, then the use is likely arbitrary.</li>
        </ul>`,
    NOTE_10: `<strong>Supplemental Register</strong> – there are actually two trademark registers, the Principal Register and the Supplemental Register. Marks that are not eligible for the Principal Register may still qualify for the Supplemental Register. While the Supplemental Register does not confer the benefits of the Principal Register, the Supplemental Register does: provide evidence that your mark was in use at the time of registration, make your mark easier for subsequent registrants to find, and enable usage of the registered trademark symbol (‘®’).
      To be eligible for the Supplemental Register, your mark must currently be used in commerce and be capable of distinguishing your goods or services from other goods or services. As the bar for acceptance is lower, it can be advisable to register on the Supplemental Register when the Principal Register is not presently available. For example, when a mark is descriptive or a proper noun (as in a surname), the mark must have secondary meaning before being registered on the Principal Register. Secondary Meaning is typically continuous and exclusive use such that consumers associate the mark with your company. Continuous and exclusive use for a five year period creates a presumption of secondary meaning. However, you may still be able to register on the Supplemental Register while waiting to establish Secondary Meaning.
      To apply to the Supplemental Register follow this link - <a href='https://teas.uspto.gov/forms/sup' target='_blank'>https://teas.uspto.gov/forms/sup</a>
      <p>NOTE: generic terms are not eligible for the Principal or Supplemental Register.</p>`,
    NOTE_14:
      '<strong>Deceptive</strong> Section 2(a) of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. §1052(a)) bars registration of marks that are deceptive or which falsely suggest a connection with persons(living or dead), institutions, beliefs or national symbols. This statutory section also bars the registration of marks that disparage any persons, institutions, beliefs or national symbols, but the U.S. Supreme Court held the anti-disparagement clause unconstitutional under the free speech clause of the First Amendment in <i>Matal v. Tam</i>, 1375.S.Ct. 1744(2017). In addition, this statutory section bars the registration of marks that are “immoral” or “scandalous”, but the U.S. Supreme Court also held such prohibition to be unconstitutional under the free speech clause of the First Amendment in Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. ____ (2019).',

    NOTE_18: `When a proposed mark so resembles an existing mark that consumers are likely to be confused into believing that the goods or services identified by both marks come the same source, then the proposed mark is not registrable. (15 U.S.C. §1052(d)). In other words, a proposed mark will not be registered if its use would create a likelihood of confusion with another mark.  According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the two key factors in determining likelihood of confusion are:
      (1)  the similarity of the two marks as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression and
      (2)    whether the goods or services identified by the two marks are so related that consumers would mistakenly believe they come from the same source. (TMEP §1207.01).
      Both factors should be considered together. Thus, the more similar the marks, the less similar the goods or services need to be to find a likelihood of confusion. (TMEP §1207.01(a)) For example, courts have found a likelihood of confusion between the following sets of marks:
      ON-LINE TODAY for Internet connection services and ONINE TODAY 	for an electronic publication. (On-Line Careline Inc. v. America Online Inc., 229 F. 3d 1080 (Fed Cir. 2000))
      MARTIN’S for wheat bran and honey bread and MARTIN’S for cheese (In re Martin’s Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., 748 F. 2d 1565 (Fed Cir. 1984))
      
      By contrast, a likelihood of confusion may not be found even with identical marks when the goods or services are sufficiently different to create a difference in commercial impression. Thus, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board found no likelihood of confusion between BOTTOMS UP  for ladies’ and children’s underwear and BOTTOMS UP  for men’s clothing noting that the wording connotes the drinking phrase “Drink Up” when applied to men’s clothing , but does not have this connotation when applied to ladies’ and children’s underwear. (In re Sydel Lingerie Co., 197 USPQ 629, 830 (TTAB 1977)).`,
    NOTE_22: `<strong>Functionality</strong> – marks that are functional are typically not eligible for trademark. For example, a mouthwash bottle that measures how much mouthwash to use should be protected by patent, not by trademark. Trademark protection is available for things like inherently distinctive container shapes. If you are seeking to trademark any design features (as opposed to a name or logo that happens to appear on a designed shape), ask:
        - Would any of the design features be eligible for patent protection?
          If yes, it is likely functional and not eligible for trademark.
        - Are any of the design features needed to compete effectively?
          If not, it is likely functional and not eligible for trademark.
        - How many alternative designs are available?
          The availability of alternative designs likely means it is not functional and is eligible for trademark.
      Keep in mind that trademarks are supposed to identify products without stifling competition. Examples of non-functional designs are the Rolls-Royce front grille and the shape of a parking meter. Examples of functional designs are the spiral shape of French fried potatoes and the shape of LEGO building blocks.`,
    NOTE_24:
      '<strong>Purely ornamental</strong> – marks that are purely ornamental are not eligible for trademark protection. (Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure §1202.03). Ornamental features, such as designs, pictorial symbols, and logos, are all eligible for trademark protection, but they must still identify the producer of the goods. Designs that are merely aesthetically pleasing without serving to identify and distinguish the source of the goods are not registrable. For example, a particular floral design on dishes is typically not protectable.'
